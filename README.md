# H1 Web Development 2 Final 

The biggest struggle I faced with this website was losing all the data and restarting from basically nothing. It was discouraging to say the least, but with the fresh template I had the oppertunity to go over some mistakes I made in the
first run.

Since I had already coded the assignment once, I could spend less time thinking about code formatting and more time fixing functions that didn't work on my old website such as the animated strike throughs and *Return* button.

Having more time to play around in css allowed me to attempt things that seemed initally challenging like the layout for the portfolio page or the animation for the return button.

This experience taught gave me a deeper understainding on the following

- ::Before and ::After psuedo classes (Animated Strikethrough, Animated Return Button)

- Object Fit and cropping (Portfolio Page)

- Positioning elements (Home Page)

- Keyframe Animation (Return Button)

- Html Scroll Behavior

And much more.
